			<h2>About me</h2> <!-- Give it a subheading too if you want -->
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m James. I&#39;m a freelance Software Engineer and Web Developer - originally from Lancaster, but now based in Heysham, Lancashire, in the UK. I&#39;ve recently taken up the position of IT Director of a new and innovative Software and Web Development company, <a href="https://github.com/TuxSoftLimited">TuxSoft</a>. I specialise both in C# and the Universal Windows Platform, and in C and GNU/Linux system Administration. I also have a wealth of webserver administration and PHP web development experience.</p>
			<p>You can find my blog at: <a href="http://jamesphillipsuk.com">jamesphillipsuk.com</a></p>
			<hr /> <!-- ^ and v It's probably best to put your own content in here -->
			<h2>About Free Software</h2> <!-- Give it a subheading too if you want -->
			<p>I'm a big supporter of the Free Software movement, both as a political stance and a sociological one.  If you make something good, that can contribute to society (or that others could contribute to for the same), why put barriers on that to hold it back, such as DRM, or restrictive licensing?</p>
			<p>On my GitHub, you'll find just that, completely free software for you to use and tinker with as you like.  What are you waiting for?  Happy Hacking! <a href="https://github.com/JamesPhillipsUK">Go There -&gt;</a></p>
