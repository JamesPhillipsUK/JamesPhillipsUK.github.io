| Code         | Amount    | Purpose                                                                                      |
|:------------ |:--------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| example HTML | 136 lines | To show the template.                                                                        |
| JavaScript   | 15 lines  | To power the dropdown menu efficiently.                                                      |
